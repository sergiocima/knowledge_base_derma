Rather, we contend that for melanoma, there is a real increase in incidence, and that the morbidity and costs associated with overdiagnosis do not out.weigh the potential reduction in morbidity and death of mela.noma primary prevention and early detection. Melanoma in the US is changing. In the past, its increas.ing burdenwascleargivenincreasesin MMincidence and mor.tality. But with greater awareness, early detection, and, dur.ing the recent decade, successful treatment of metastatic MM that has become a reality for some, MM mortality has de.clinedsignificantly. This iswhytheinterpretation ofMMtrends has become more challenging. Without MM randomized clinical trials, a recent large screening initiative with primary care clinicians in western Pennsylvaniawasassociatedwitha 79%increase inmelanoma diagnosis (95% CI, 15%-138%). There was no associated in.crease in dermatology visits or skin surgeries, indicators of overdiagnosis-associated morbidities.3 Asubsequentstudy published 5 years later that expanded on the same patient population found an increase in thin melanoma incidence among the screened population of 30.4 vs 14.4 in the unscreened population (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.1-3.1) and a nonsignificant decrease in thick melanomas.4 A recent analysis of the general US population, from 2010 to 2018, suggested nofurtherincrease in thin melanomas. Fur.thermore,incidenceof the thickestmelanomas (T4,>4.0 mm), less likely owing to overdiagnosis, continued to increase, with anannual percentagechange of 3.32%during that period (95% CI, 2.06%-4.60%). They were also more likely to be diag.nosed in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients.5 Current studies suggest that we are not done in under.standing the true extent, however large or small, of the nega.tive externalities from MM diagnosis and treatment on pa.tients, although the positive externalities are clear. Focusing onMMthicknessmayhelp clarifyourunderstandingand avoid underdiagnosis in this group. While we need better evidence to prove that current screening efforts save lives, we should not stop such initiatives because of concern regarding overdiagnosis. Marcelo L. Paiva, MPP Martin A.

Melanoma mortality has fallen by a quarter and is now less than the 1975 baseline.2 That is likely associated with improved treatment and serves as a testament to those engaged in the develop.ment of immunotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. Treat.ment matters. However,toourknowledge,melanomascreeningandearly detectionhaveneverbeenshowntoreducemortality,butthey areassociatedwithincreased overdiagnosis.Thescreening ini.tiative in western Pennsylvania cited by Paiva and Weinstock showed a classic epidemiologic signature of overdiagnosis, which was a substantial increase in the rate of thin melano.mas diagnosed and no difference in the rate of thick melano.mas diagnosedbetween thescreenedandunscreened groups.3 Furthermore, the thickness trends in the US population cited by Paiva and Weinstock are incomplete. They do not include melanoma in situ, the most rapidly increasing type of mela.noma whose incidence rates now equal that of invasive melanoma.4 Patients who receive a diagnosis of melanoma in situ arelabeledandtreated ashavingcancerwhenmostofthem have likely received a diagnosis of an overdiagnosed cancer. Paiva and Weinstock contend that the harms associated with overdiagnosis do not outweigh the potential benefit of melanoma screening. This is a curious position to take given that, to our knowledge, there is noevidenceto support screen.ing saving lives, which is the purported benefit, but there are multiplestudiesshowingthatscreeningisassociatedwithover.diagnosis. By definition, individuals who receive an overdi.agnosis canonly be harmedbecausethere isnothing tofix, and the harms of overdiagnosis are more than just increased der.matology visits and skin surgery–related complications. There are financial harms from guideline-indicated follow-ups, re.peated biopsies, and denial of life or health insurance. There are also psychological harms associated with receiving the di.agnosisof cancer.Howcan benefitsoutweigh harms, whenthe harms are more certain than the benefits? jamadermatology.com JAMA Dermatology September 2022 Volume 158, Number 9 1083 © 2022 American Medical Association.

What is clear from numerous studies is that over.diagnosis is substantial in melanoma, and what is less clear is what, if anything, should be done about it.5 Until those argu.ing for general population screening for melanoma can dem.onstrate its usefulness, the practice should be continued to be questioned. Adewole S.
