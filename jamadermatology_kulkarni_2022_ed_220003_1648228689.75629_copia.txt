One simple and straight.forward way to improve the risk:benefit and cost:benefit ratios would be to screen people at higher risk for melanoma, such as older patients, patients with a family history of mela.noma, or patients with apersonal historyof skincancer.12 This type of risk stratification would simultaneously increase the numbers of melanomasdetectedper individualsscreened and reduce the total number of overdiagnoses. Unintended Consequences of Reduction in Screening It is not sufficient to focus on the risks of screening without also evaluating the consequences of not screening. The COVID-19 pandemic may provide an experiment of nature that allows us to determine effect of reduced screening.13 Several COVID-19 melanoma studies are in progress, and we may soon be able to quantify the effects of decreased mela.noma screening. There are other potential unintended consequences from focusing solely on overdiagnosis.

However, every new technology (particularly in the early stages) will have some rate of overdiagnosis. Throwing out new technology (or worse, not developing it) because of a fearofoverdiagnosismeanswemaydiscardorneverfindsome.thing truly valuable. If we look to prostate cancer as an ex.ample, prostate-specificantigen positivity was associatedwith high biopsy rates and resultant overdiagnosis, but this was a necessary intermediate step before recognizing the need for better screeningand risk stratification, such as the use of mag.neticresonanceimaging.14 Hadscreeningbeen halted, it might not have been possible to improve these programs. This is the inevitable course of applying science to medicine; it is never static. Just as we have a responsibility to the individual pa.tient’s immediate care, we also have a responsibility to soci.ety to improve care through technology. Our goal should be to continually pursue better diagnostic and prognostic mark.ers and be alert to their combined risks and benefits. Professional Responsibility to Patients As medical professionals, we have a contract with individual patients and society to reduce melanoma-specific death and morbidity for the individual and prioritize care responsibly for society.Many federalagenciesandpayergroups focuson mini.mizing costs and optimizing outcomes. However, physicians are the only professional advocatesforindividual patients; we have a responsibility to assure that the best interests of pa.tients are served. Regarding melanoma screening, we need to adopt practices that are appropriately tailored to each pa.tient. However, for public screenings, it may be more respon.sible to shift away from the general population toward higher.risk populations that permit cost-conscious care. There is growing understanding that certain high-risk groups are most likelytohave a lethalmelanoma, including olderpatient popu.lations, those uninsured or without a regular dermatologist, those with prior history of melanoma, and those that have noticed a concerningorchanging spot.15 Asdermatologists,de.veloping strategies to enhance screening of higher-risk indi.viduals should be our priority. Summary Ideally, we would screen everyone rapidly and inexpensively and only excise lesions with lethal potential (without over.diagnosis). Until that strategy is possible, we have an obliga.tion to minimize harm, optimize outcomes for patients and society, and advance technologies for the future. Overdiag.nosis is only one consideration in balancing those responsi.bilities and must be considered within the wider context of costs and benefits. ARTICLE INFORMATION Author Affiliations: Department of Dermatology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland (Kulkarni, Yu, Leachman); Department of Biomedical Engineering, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland (Kulkarni); Cancer Early Detection Advanced Research Center, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland (Kulkarni); Operative Care Division, VA Portland Health Care System, Portland, Oregon (Kulkarni, Yu). Corresponding Author: Sancy A.
