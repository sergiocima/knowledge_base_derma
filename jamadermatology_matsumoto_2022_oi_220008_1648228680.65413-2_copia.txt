Data analysis was performed January 2020 to January 2022. INTERVENTIONS Primary care clinicians were offered training in melanoma identification through skin examination and encouraged to offer annual screening to patients 35 years and older. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thickness of melanomas diagnosed in screened and unscreened patients. RESULTS Among 595 799 analyzed screen-eligible patients, 144 851 (24.3%) were screened at least once. Screened patients were older (median [IQR] age, 59 [49-67] vs 55 [45-66] years) and more likely to be female (82 244 [56.8%] vs 250 806 [55.6%]; P < .001) and non-Hispanic White (124 747 [86.1%] vs 375 890 [83.4%]; P < .001) than unscreened patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and race, screened patients were more likely than unscreened patients to be diagnosed with in situ (incidence, 30.4 vs 14.4; hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% CI, 2.1-3.1; P < .001) or thin invasive ( 1 mm) melanoma (incidence, 24.5 vs 16.1; HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2.2; P < .001). Screened patients were also more likely than unscreened patients to be diagnosed with in situ (incidence, 26.7 vs 12.9; HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.6; P < .001) or thin invasive ( 1 mm) interval melanomas (melanoma diagnosed at least 60 days after initial screening examination) (incidence, 18.5 vs 14.4; HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P = .03). Incidence of melanoma thicker than 4 mm in unscreened and screened patients, respectively, was 3.3 and 2.7 (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4-1.4; P = .38) for all melanomas and 2.7 and 1.5 (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.2-1.2; P = .15) for interval melanomas. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this quality improvement study, primary care–based melanoma screening was associated with increased detection of thin melanoma, raising concern about overdiagnosis. Further studies with longer follow-up are needed to determine the influence of screening on the incidence of thick melanoma and outcomes associated with high costs and poor outcomes, such as metastasis. Author Affiliations: Author  affiliations are listed at the end of this article.  JAMA Dermatol. doi:10.1001/jamadermatol.2022.0253 Published online April 6, 2022.

However, to our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials of melanoma screening have been performed. The US Preventive Services Task Force currently gives visual skin cancer screening of asymptomatic patients an “I” rating owing to insufficient evi.dence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of skin can.cerscreening.2 Thereisconcernthat melanoma screening may lead to overdiagnosis, or an increased detection of thin tu.mors that would not have been detected otherwise and that are unlikely to progress to a harmful cancer.3 In 2014, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), a large health care system with both community.based and academic practices, began a primary care skin can.cer screening quality initiative that has been previously described.4 Briefly,primary careclinicians employedby UPMC were invited to participate in a voluntary program in which pa.tients 35 years and older who presented for routine office vis.itswereofferedfullskinexaminationannually(guidancebased on the screening guidelines in place in Germany at the time).5 Optional training in skin cancer detection was available using avalidatedtrainingprogramviaanonlinemodule.6 Duringthe first year of the initiative, we found an increase in melanoma detection, particularly for in situ melanoma, and a decrease in the median thickness of invasive melanoma, but no differ.ence in the incidence of melanoma thicker than 1 mm, in pa.tients who were screened compared with those who were not screened.4 Wenowreport findings ofmelanomaincidenceand thickness from the first 5 years of the UPMC primary care screening program. Methods Approvals The screening initiative, including clinician outreach and training and system changes to the electronic health record (EHR), was approved as a quality improvement project. Col.lection of outcome data about screening dispositions, patient demographics, and melanoma diagnoses was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board, which waived the need for patient informed consent owing to determination that study presented minimal risk to par.ticipants and could not be practically carried out without a waiver of consent. Program Overview Primary care clinicians employed by UPMC were invited and encouraged, but not required, to complete a web-based, vali.dated, skin cancer training (a previously validated system called INFORMED [INternet curriculum FOR Melanoma Early Detection])6 adaptedforuseinthiscontext.Thisprogramtrains primary care clinicians on how to perform a full body skin ex.amination and to recognize melanoma, keratinocyte carcino.mas, and commonly encountered benign lesions, such as seb-Key Points Question Is primary care–based melanoma screening associated with melanoma incidence? Findings In this quality improvement study among 595 799 patients, primary care–based melanoma screening was associated with increased detection of thin melanoma (in situ and thickness 1 mm). While decreased incidence of thick melanoma (>2 and >4 mm) was observed in screened vs unscreened patients, this difference was not statistically significant. Meaning Population-based screening for melanoma was associated with increased detection of thin melanoma, raising concerns that screening carries the potential harm of overdiagnosis of indolent lesions; longer follow-up is needed to determine if this influences outcomes such as incidence of thick melanoma, distant metastases, or mortality. orrheickeratosis andcherryangiomas.Training rateswere only tracked during the first year of the initiative and were previ.ouslyreported.7 TheEHR(EPIC)wasmodifiedtoprovideanalert whena patient 35 yearsor olderdidnothave adocumentedskin cancer screening in the prior 12 months and to allow the clini.cian to note with a single click if screening was performed or was already completed. Clinicians were instructed to note screening to be completed if they performed the screening or if the patient reported they had been screened in the previous year by another clinician, but no formal documentation of the examinationwasrequired.Physicianswereencouragedbyphy.sicianleadership to participate and were educated about mela.noma andthis pilot programthroughaseriesoftownhallmeet.ings at the beginning of the initiative. Physicians were not compensated for screening above their standard billing for the office visit.4 Some offices posted information about the pro.gram in their office, and some screens could have been pa.tient initiated. Screening could be performed by any physi.cian, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant in the UPMC system.Afterdetectionof a lesionthat was concerningforskin cancer or determination thatapatient wasathighrisk forcan.cer, primary care clinicianscould perform a biopsy or refer the patient to a dermatologist of their choosing for further evalu.ation through routine standard-of-care practice. Only pa.tients in the screen-eligible population (defined below) were included in this analysis. Screen-Eligible Population and Screening Status Case Definitions Screen-eligible patients were defined as those 35 years and older who presented to a UPMC-employed primary care clini.cian for aprimarycare visit(defined asavisit to a primarycare office in which a Current Procedural Terminology code for an office visit or annual physical examination was coded) be.tween January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Patients who were diagnosed with melanoma prior to their first primary care clinician visit in the study period or had a screening date that occurred during the study period but prior to their first pri.mary care visit in the study period were excluded from analy.sis (Figure 1).

For patients who were not screened during the study pe.riod, or who were diagnosed with melanoma prior to their first screening, the date of their first primary care visit during the study period was used as their entry date into the unscreened cohort. For patients with at least 1 screening (provided screen.ing occurred prior to or on the day of their first melanoma di.agnosis in the study period if applicable), the date their first screening was noted in the EHR was considered their pri.mary screening visit date and was used as their date of entry into the screened cohort. For each screen-eligible patient, in addition to screening status and date, the following patient.level data were recorded:age, sex, and self-identified raceand ethnicity. Melanoma Diagnoses Text-based searching of pathology reports for all screen.eligiblepatientsavailable intheUPMCsystemwasusedtoiden.tify primary melanoma diagnoses and date of diagnosis. Re.portswerereviewed toexclude re-excisionsandtoconfirm that only primarylesions were included. Breslowthickness was re.corded for each case, using information from the initial pa.thology report and, when applicable, from pathology reports from re-excisions. To better understand the impact of screen.ing on incident melanomas, we attempted to exclude preva.lent melanomas (ie, those present at the time the patient en.tered the screen-eligible cohort). To do this, we categorized melanomas diagnosed at least 60 days after the first screen.ing visit inscreened patients,andat least 60 days after the first screen-eligibleprimarycarevisitinunscreenedpatients,asin.tervalmelanomas. Foreach eligiblepatient,only thefirstmela.noma diagnosis during the study period was considered in the analysis, although the number of patients with multiple pri.mary melanomas was collected. Statistical Analysis This study was reported using Standards for Quality Improve.mentReportingExcellence(SQUIRE)reportingguidelines,which provideaframeworkforreportingnewknowledgeaboutsystem.levelworktoimprovethequality,safety,andvalueofhealthcare (eAppendix in the Supplement).8 The primary outcome of interests was the cumulative incidence of melanoma by T categoryinscreenedvsunscreenedpatients.Secondaryanalyses were performed for all melanomas and for interval melanomas and for all patients and for patients 65 years or older (chosen owing to older age as a risk factor for melanoma incidence and mortalityandowing to the potential implications forguidelines relevanttoaUSMedicarepopulation).Descriptivestatisticswere calculatedforpatientdemographicandscreeningcharacteristics, and .2 tests were used to compare rates of melanoma diagnosis bythicknessinscreenedandunscreenedpatients.Pvalueswere 1-tailed with a significance level of P <.05.

The 60-day window was chosen as a rea.sonable period during which a patient would have been ex.pected to be referred to a specialist for definitive diagnosis (eTable in the Supplement). After adjusting for age, sex, and White race, melanomas in screened patients were signifi.cantly more likely than those in unscreened patients to be in situ(incidence, 30.4 vs 14.4;HR, 2.6; 95%CI, 2.1-3.1; P <.001), thin invasive melanoma (≤1 mm) (incidence, 24.5 vs 16.1; HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2.2; P <.001)(Table 2). We also found that screened patients were more likely than unscreened patients to be diagnosed with interval melanomas that were in situ (in.cidence, 26.7 vs 12.9; HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.6; P <.001) or thin invasive lesions (<1 mm) (incidence, 18.5 vs 14.4; HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P =.03)(Table 3). While thin melanomas weremore frequently diagnosed in screened than unscreened patients, we observed a trend toward a reduction in thicker melano.mas(allandintervalmelanomas)amongscreenedpatientswith HRs that were less than 1 for melanomas thicker than 2 and 4 mm, particularly in those 65 years and older (Figure 2 and Tables 2 and 3). However, these findings did not reach statis.tical significance. To adjust for variations in factors such as those related to patients’geography(sociodemographicfactors,accesstohealth care) and to the primary care physicians caring for these pa.tients, frailty models were used to estimate HRs for screening on risk of melanoma diagnosis by thickness adjusting for age, sex, and White race as well as clinician practice (eTable in the Supplement). This did not significantly change our findings. Discussion In this study of a primary care–based melanoma screening ini.tiative, weobserved ahigher cumulative incidence of thin and in situ melanoma among screened vs unscreened patients. Whileearly detectionof melanomaisa strategytoreducemela.noma morbidity and mortality, the value of a cancer screen.ing program should most rigorously be measured not by the number of new, early cancers detected, but by its impact on the development of late-stage disease and its associated mor.bidity, cost, and mortality. The significant increase in mela.noma incidence in the US, particularly thin melanoma, with.out a concomitant decrease in melanoma mortality, raises the concernthatearlydetectionefforts,suchasvisualskinscreen.ing, may result in overdiagnosis, meaning the detection of in.dolent lesions that would not have progressed to fatal mela.noma prior to being detected by routine care.3,9 Similarly, in Europe, while there are significant disparities in melanoma thicknessby health care expenditure,mortality rates have less variability, suggesting thatwealthiercountrieswith moreregu.lar and established melanoma screening and awareness pro.grams have higher detection rates of indolent melanoma.10 We did also observe a lower cumulative incidence of thick melanomasin screened vs unscreened patients, withthemost notable decrease observed for interval melanomas among pa.tients 65 years and older (HR, 0.6; P =.15 for lesions >2 mm; and HR, 0.3; P =.05 for lesions >4 mm).

Explanations of why screening could reduce the incidence of thicker melanoma include that thinner lesions with the biologic potential to progress to thick melanoma may be diagnosed and removed in the screened population, preventing them from becoming thick melano.mas. Alternatively, patients who are screened may be more knowledgeableabout melanoma(either at baseline or through knowledge gainedduringthe screeningprocess)and thusmore likely to identify and seek attention for melanoma before it reached a thickness of 4 mm.11 Few patients in our study were followed up for at least 5 years, and it is possible that, particu.larlyforslower-growingsuperficialspreading melanomas, lon.ger follow-up time is needed to fully appreciate any differ.ences in the incidence of thick melanomas between the screened and unscreened populations. Additionally, a larger sample size would likely be needed to see a difference be.tween these groups given the relatively low number of thick melanomas in population studied. While to our knowledge there are no large, randomized studiesofmelanomascreening,otherlargeobservationalstud.ies have been reported. The SCREEN (Skin Cancer Research to provide EvidenceforEffectiveness in NorthernGermany)proj.ect conducted in Schleswig-Holstein Germany was a 1-year in.tervention in which all patients 20 years and older holding statutory health insurance were invited to receive asingle skin cancerscreeningfromatrainedphysician,mostofwhomwere generalists.Inthe 5 yearsfollowingthisintervention,therewas an initial apparent reduction in melanoma mortality of nearly 50%. However, this was not sustained on follow-up in Schleswig-Holstein,norwasthesameoutcomeobservedwhen skin cancer screening was offered on a biannualbasistoall citi.zens 35 years and older in the rest of Germany.5,12,13 Other criti.cisms of the SCREEN project include that a 50% reduction in melanoma deaths is unlikely due to a screening intervention in 19% of the population and that the reduction in melanoma deaths in the screened region was accompanied by an increase in death from undefined malignant neoplasm, suggesting that misclassificationratherthanreductioninmelanomadeathcould explain the initial findings.14 Aretrospectiveanalysisofthe Schleswig-Holsteindatacomparingobservedvsexpectedrates ofintervalmelanomas(definedasthosediagnosedwithin2years after an initial negative screen) found an increase in the inci.dence of melanoma in situ and a decrease in invasive mela.noma. Compared with our study, this study involved a shorter windowoftime,includedfewermelanomas,andusedasacom.parator reference the historic melanoma incidence prior to the SCREENintervention.15 Melanomascreeningandpatientaware.ness can change over time, and a strength of the present study is our use of a contemporary unscreened population as a com.parator group. The greatest strength of the present study is our ability to collect real-world data over a 5-year period from nearly 600 000 patients. More than 144 000 patients were screened for skin cancer at least once, allowing us to compare the cu.mulative incidence of melanoma by thickness in contempo.rary cohorts of screened and unscreened patients. A prospec.tive randomized study of this size would not be practical or cost-effective. Our initiative did not offer physician compen.sation specifically for screening and used existing health care infrastructure, resulting in low direct costs. Previous studies have shown that harms such as increased costs due to derma.jamadermatology.com JAMA Dermatology Published online April 6, 2022 E7 © 2022 American Medical Association.

It was a nonrandom.ized, retrospective analysis of a quality initiative. Although we adjusted our findings for patient age, sex, and race and eth.nicity, there are likely differences not captured in patient demographics that may confer melanoma risk, such as skin type, family history of melanoma, and sun exposure history. Additionally, factors such as patients’ willingness to be screened and physicians’ decisions of which patients toscreen were not taken into account, although we did not see a sig.nificant change in the findings when physician practice group was added to the model. It is also likely that some melano.mas in this study were identified first by the patient and then brought to the attention of the screening physician, and thus all tumors in screened patients may not actually be screen.detected. While the screening education was standardized, it was optional, and training rates werereported for the first year ofthe intervention but were nottracked after this, limiting our ability to correlate melanoma thickness with primary care cli.nician participation in the optional training program.4 The ac.tual screening process was neither standardized nor formally documented.Itisunlikelythatall screeningswereequallythor.ough and that all screeners had the same sensitivity for mela.noma. Additionally, because clinicians couldmark the screen.ingas completedifthepatientreported a skincancerscreening fromanotherhealthcareclinicianinthepreviousyear,wecan.not be certain that the screening date noted in the EHR is the exact date on which it was performed, nor by the person who performed the screening, and it is also likely that the same pa.tient-reported screening was noted at 2 or more visits, mak.ing it impossible to quantify the number of times an indi.vidualpatientwasscreened.Wefoundthatmostpatientswere only screened once during the study period and thus cannot draw conclusions about what impact regular screenings every 1 or 2 years may have had. The skin cancer screening examination also likely has an educational and awareness component that may contribute to early melanoma detection and thus have benefits beyond direct lesion detection. Because UPMC is not a closed system, it is likely that some patients had melanomas diagnosed at non-UPMC facilities that were not captured in our data. Furthermore, UPMC is a dynamic organization, and thus the primary care clinicians and practices employed by UPMC fluctuated over the 5-year period of this study. Conclusions In this quality improvement study, our findings show that screening for skin cancer was associated with a higher inci.dence of thin melanoma. While we did observe a lower inci.dence of thick melanomas in screened patients, particularly interval melanomas and in patients 65 years and older, these results were not statistically significant. The number of thick (>4 mm) melanomas in our population was low, and median follow-up time was only about 3 years. Our findings and study design are important because we will be able to quantify the association of screening with melanoma overdiagnosis (a po.tential harm of screening), and withmore follow-up time, with the incidence of thick melanomas (a benefit of screening that would be anticipated to influence survival, morbidity, and treatmentcosts). Modeling studies havesuggested thatscreen.ing older patients, particularly men, for melanoma may be cost-effective.18 Real-world data can add to this to help to de-termine which patients, if any, can benefit from screening and the optimal screening strategies that maximize benefit and minimize cost and harms. Longer follow-up is needed to fully determine the association of screeningwith outcomessuch as the incidence of thick melanoma, treatment cost and morbid.ity, distant metastasis, and death. ARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: January 21, 2022. Published Online: April 6, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamadermatol.2022.0253 Author Affiliations: Department of Dermatology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Matsumoto, Ferris); University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Wack); Center for Dermatoepidemiology, VA Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island (Weinstock); Departments of Dermatology and Epidemiology, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island (Weinstock); Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Harvard T.H.
