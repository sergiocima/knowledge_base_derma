Opinion Melanoma Screening—Intuition and Hope Are Not Enough Robert A. Swerlick, MD In this issue of JAMA Dermatology, Matsumoto et al1 present their observations of a large patient cohort in a quality im.provement study examining melanomas diagnosed within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) system. The objectiveofthisstudywas“to compare thickness-specific Editorial incidence of melanoma in screened vs unscreened pa-Related article tients following the initia.tion of a primary care–based skin cancer screening initiative.” Patients were divided into 2 groups, a cohort receiving primary care skin examination and a control group without a skin examination, and followed up for 5 years. The main findings were increased detection of thin melanomasobserved patientsintheprimarycare–basedmela.nomascreeninggroupcomparedwith thecontrolgroup. Fewer thick melanomas (>2 and >4 mm) were observed in screened vs unscreened patients, but this difference was not statisti.cally significant. The UPMC efforts examining the use of routine skin ex.aminations to generate better melanoma outcomes1 are to be lauded. This project isamajor undertakingto addressbigques.tionssurrounding melanomasurveillance. Intuitively, skin ex.aminations deployed to detect early melanoma make sense, and it is broadly viewed as a given that early detection from these efforts will result in fewer melanoma deaths. This as.sumption has resulted in the widespread belief in and broad use of regular skin examinations to decrease melanoma mortality, despite the lack of evidence to support the effec.tiveness of these approaches. This work was not conceived to demonstrate that in.creased surveillance through skin examinations will gener.ate a classic signature of overdiagnosis. However, this is what they found, with increased numbers of thin melanomas diag.nosed, especially in younger populations.1 More than 25 years ago, my colleague and I raised concerns about the melanoma strategies that were being increasingly deployed and the un.intended consequences of increased scrutiny.2 We raised the possibility that increased surveillance intensity was a driver ofincreased detection ofhistologically worrisomebut biologi.cally benign disease, and that much of the observed increase in melanoma incidence noted since 1970 was due to overdi.agnosis.Overdiagnosis is defined as a diagnosis ofdisease that would never cause symptoms or death during an individual’s lifetime.3 In the case of melanoma, a given tumor may meet histological criteria for the diagnosis of melanoma but not be biologically aggressive. Thus, the histological diagnosis may be correct, but the prediction of malignant behavior incorrect because of limitations of histological tools to predict an inher.ently unpredictable future. Subsequent studies have consis.tently provided evidence that this concern was justified.4,5 In an editorial in JAMA Dermatology in 2021, Dr Ferris wrote, “The ultimate goal of early detection is not to find thinner melanomas, but to reduce melanoma-associatedmor.bidity and mortality.”6 I could not agree more. The purpose of applying increasing amounts of screening intensity is to avoid melanoma death. If not for the cancer risk we associate with nevi,theywouldbeviewedascosmeticconcernsandleftalone. It has been the aim of multiple investigators to demonstrate that efforts focused on pigmented lesions and early mela.noma detection result in less melanoma mortality. However, despite decades of effort, the goal of demonstrating an effect on melanoma death remains elusive. In fact, despite public messaging to the contrary, to my knowledge there is no evi.dence that routine skinexaminations have any effecton mela.noma mortality. Because of the long-standing inability to demonstrate ef.fects ofskinexaminationsonmelanoma mortality, studiessuch as the one reported by Matsumoto et al1 have focused on sur.rogate outcomes. Tumor thickness and overall size tend to be the default outcomes captured, the rationale being that cap.ture of early melanomawill invariably translate to lives saved. As noted previously, more melanomas are invariably found in screened groups, and tumors diagnosed are almost exclu.sively smaller and thinner (stage shift). The stage shift to smaller tumors should not be viewed as success and is very strongevidenceofoverdiagnosis. Survival after diagnosismay be highlighted, but this statistic is fraught with lead-time and length-time bias issues.7 The observations in the study by Matsumoto et al1 are not unique and are representative of a pattern that is consistent over time: apply increased surveillance, observe increased melanoma incidencewiththe increasebeingmade upof early.stage tumors, followed by a call to undertake a randomized clinical trial to test whether screening decreases melanoma mortality. Underlying this recurring sequence are several as.sumptionsthatarebecomingincreasingly tenuous.Eachround of imperfect studies failing to demonstrate mortality benefit has not resulted in questioning whether early melanoma de.tection strategies can prolong lives. What is assumed is that with the right mix of novel technology, training, and diagnos.tic tools targeted to the right patients, we can prevent mela.nomadeaths.Whatifthatassumptionissimplywrong?Screen.ing skeptics cannot prove a negative, but it should fall on screening advocates to demonstrate that such activities add value to patients’ lives. Discussions of trade-offs and risk.benefit analysis are meaningless when no benefit can be demonstrated. jamadermatology.com JAMA Dermatology Published online April 6, 2022 E1 © 2022 American Medical Association.

The authors make a brief refer.ence regarding the need for longer-term follow-up to deter.mine associations with melanoma mortality, but no data regarding melanoma deaths in their cohort are presented. It is difficult to extrapolate how an extension of the current study couldtranslateintoanymeaningfuldataonmelanomamortality. Why has a randomized clinical trial looking at the effect of screeningskinexaminationsonmelanomamortalitynotalready been performed?Such anundertaking would requireasubstan.tial investment of time and money,and a funding entity would needtodeem thisproject aworthyundertaking.Whiletheneed for such a trial has been highlighted repeatedly, very little has beenpublishedregardinghowsuchastudycouldbeundertaken andsufficientlypoweredto detectaneffectofscreeningexami.nationson melanoma deaths.A single researchletterdescribed efforts to develop a protocol for a randomized clinical trial in Norway.9 Their conclusions were that a skin cancer screening trial to reduce melanoma mortality in Norway was unwise be-cause deaths caused by melanoma were too rare in Norway to deploy a realistictrialandexpect definitiveresults. Perhapsthe answeras to why a randomized clinical trial has not been done is thatentities whomay have the resources tofund suchan un.dertaking realize that it is unlikely to yield useful results. Some skepticism as to whether a randomized clinical trial can be accomplished is based on the concern that the study population can be reliably limited to those at highest risk for melanoma death. This concern is consistent with an emerging consensus within the melanoma early detection community that current nontargeted screening efforts represent low.value care and that efforts should be focused on highest-risk populations.10,11 However, the first pass at defining the criteria toidentifytheat-riskpopulationswasgenerouslyinclusive(Fitz.patrick skin types I-III, ages 35-75 years),11 and even this per.missivefilterhasnotbeentranslatedinanymeaningfulwayinto clinical practice, medical education, or public messaging. DespitemultiplepublicationsfromtheUS PreventiveSer.vices Task Force highlighting the limited scientific basis sup.porting skin cancer screening,12 the skin-check culture in der.matology is alive and well, with widespread clinical practice pattern adoption before clinical benefits have been dem.onstrated. Dermatology practices have a consistent flow of low-risk patients without specific skinissues whoscheduleap.pointmentsforroutineskinchecks.Thisunderscoresakeyques.tion: how should a study such as the one by Matsumoto et al1 translate intoclinical practice, training, andpublicmessaging? There is a growing consensus that some changes in approach and publicmessagingarewarranted.However,thehabitofrou.tine skin examinations to prevent melanoma death is strongly embedded into practice, as well as in the mindset of many pa.tients. The skin examination is a diagnostic test, and like any diagnostic test, its value is context dependent. No single diag.nostictest shouldbe useduniversally in well populations,and the skin examination is no exception to this rule. What is the bestapproachto begin tosocializetheideawe needtostepback fromnontargetedskinchecksbecausetheymaybringlittlevalue to and may harm patients? Asastart, these ideas need tobeunderstood and embraced by those who train the next generations of dermatologists. We arestill at the stage of an internal discussion among select phy.siciansand epidemiologists.

Even if the specialty is not ready yet, I believe it is just a matter of time before this must be done. ARTICLE INFORMATION Author Affiliation: Department of Dermatology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia. Corresponding Author: Robert A.
